# reddit-scraper
Group Two.

## Description
A simple app which lets you enter the name of a subreddit returning one image along with it's comments. Subsequent presses will return other images from the subreddit. Long pressing the image will allow you to save the image to your device under ```images/RedditScraper```. The first time trying this will show you the rationale for requiring the storage permission before requesting the storage permission.
